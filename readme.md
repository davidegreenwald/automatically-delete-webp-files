# Automatically Delete Webp Files WordPress Plugin
This plugin is in beta. Please test and let me know about bugs!

This plugin prevents .webp files from being orphaned in the WordPress Media
Library. It makes sure to remove .webp files generated by EWWW (or from any
source) when their parent .jpg, .png or .gif image and thumbnails are deleted.

This allows you to use tools such as the WebPonize app to make .webp files with
no need to track them in a database a la EWWW. This means you can safely empty
the EWWW database table, which bloats quickly and is only really necessary for
tracking .webp file paths.

What this doesn't do: because WordPress doesn't recognize .webp files, this
doesn't solve issues with regenerating thumbnails, it's best to let a plugin
such as EWWW handle it or by separately deleting and regenerating the .webp
files.
